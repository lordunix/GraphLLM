Aaaah
[10.585]
It&#39;s Rewind time.
[12.341]
If I controlled Rewind I would want
[16.062]
Fortnite and Marques Brownlee.
[24.834]
Is this what you wanted?
[25.848]
You know who I would have asked for?
[27.944]
Quit horsing around.
[30.239]
Play me some of that jumping music.
[32.676]
Did you say jumping music?
[34.072]
Jumping music?
[39.622]
Everybody! Off!
[48.192]
Not even a thank you?!
[57.676]
Is that Marques?
[59.438]
I want Liza!
[64.405]
Yeaaaaaahhhh!!!!
[70.507]
So guys, apparently
we control Rewind this year.
[76.017]
Y&#39;all we can do whatever we want.
What do we do?
[85.011]
There&#39;s one thing this video needs.
[88.31]
K-pop!
[108.973]
Can I have a Royal Wedding?
[111.132]
Yeah, but you&#39;re marrying Bongo Cat.
[112.863]
Wait, what?
[122.334]
Rewind needs more science.
[123.921]
Can we do an experiment?
[125.758]
I love that. Melting lipstick.
[133.23]
I want to eat something.
[135.102]
Mukbang!
[136.845]
Yes, let&#39;s do it in Korea!
[145.191]
Gallop, what do you want?
[154.964]
Marshmello needs to be in this video.
[158.036]
Who is Marshmello?
[159.675]
How about yodeling kid?
[162.104]
With Adam Rippon!
[182.612]
Guys, let&#39;s do the
In My Feelings challenge.
[184.944]
Right!
[188.239]
I love this song!
[189.432]
Let&#39;s hear the remix!
[222.998]
Wait, wait, wait. 
Hold on, hold on.
[225.062]
You know who really needs to be 
in this Rewind video?
[228.336]
Everyone who managed to do something 
bigger than themselves this year.
[231.398]
Found a way to help the causes 
that matter to them most.
[234.664]
To everyone who proved it&#39;s ok
to talk about mental health this year.
[238.087]
Showing our viewers that it&#39;s ok
to go through tough times like that.
[241.53]
It takes a lot of bravery to be that vulnerable
and I&#39;m so proud of this community.
[245.652]
I think this year&#39;s Rewind should 
celebrate the fierce, fabulous
[249.698]
and empowering art of drag.
[251.591]
I want to see all of you be your 
own kind of beautiful.
[254.618]
And to those people who have
raised money in the field of education.
[257.739]
Can we also give a moment to Asian 
representation in entertainment this year?
[262.367]
Major strides were made.
[263.76]
And to the people who put aside 
their differences.
[265.778]
Yeah, and created something really special.
[267.615]
Here&#39;s to all women in 2018
for finding their voices.
[271.384]
It&#39;s nice seeing how women grew
and were empowered.
[274.998]
Can we give a moment to working moms?
Let&#39;s do it!
[277.776]
To everyone who taught, or learned,
something new this year.
[282.276]
And to all the refugees and
anyone looking for a home.
[285.337]
All of us should send a toast to the 
kids who follow their dreams.
[289.538]
I want to thank the whole community that
always supports during our best and worst.
[294.426]
We are a family,
we are a team.
[296.688]
Family is everything.
[298.46]
I want to give a moment to everyone
who supported me when I got sick.
[302.224]
All of the comments and messages I got
made me feel like I wasn&#39;t alone.
[307.222]
We&#39;re forgetting something.
[311.312]
I think we should read the comments.
[322.401]
Yeah I have a feeling this is going to get
a little bit crazy.
[326.741]
Let&#39;s give the people what they want.
[413.038]
Aaaahhh
[417.803]
That&#39;s hot, that&#39;s hot.
