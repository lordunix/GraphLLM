A language model is a probabilistic model of a natural language.
In 1980, the first significant statistical language model was proposed, and during the decade IBM performed ‘Shannon-style’ experiments, in which potential sources for language modeling improvement were identified by observing and analyzing the performance of human subjects in predicting or correcting text.[2]

Language models are useful for a variety of tasks, including speech recognition[3] (helping prevent predictions of low-probability (e.g. nonsense) sequences), machine translation,[4] natural language generation (generating more human-like text), optical character recognition, handwriting recognition,[5] grammar induction,[6] and information retrieval.[7][8]

Large language models, currently their most advanced form, are a combination of larger datasets (frequently using words scraped from the public internet), feedforward neural networks, and transformers. They have superseded recurrent neural network-based models, which had previously superseded the pure statistical models, such as word n-gram language model.
